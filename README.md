##### Take note: *Only the apk is currently available and not the source. The app uses Google fusion tables to store the location data, which means it does not currently have the ability to take a high amount of traffic.*

## **What is StreetSafety?**<br />
-> Anonymous Reporting of Potential Threatening Activities<br />
-> Location, Time, and Activity Information Stored on Cloud Server<br />
-> Threats of Safety Data Accessible on Web/Mobile Interface<br />

"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” – Benjamin Franklin"
* Safety is awareness of your surroundings
* A crime cannot be reported before it happens, but possible warnings could help public safety
* Law enforcement surveillance of possible target areas would put too high burden on the government and available resources
* This app lets users decide what constitutes as possible threat


---

* Bullies
* Drug Activities
* Fights

#### Threat Selection
* Reporters can anonymously submit any type of threat within a subset of categories
* User can filter out threats based on categories/and or threat level
* Reporter reputations are voted up and down to limit false reporting
* Reporter’s identification remains anonymous, but their reputation is based on user feedback

#### Why we are better!
* BEFORE the crime or incident happens!
* Community Centric 
    1. Start with Boyle Heights!
    2. Need grass roots marketing in community
* User filters what is threatening to them
* Develop algorithms to limit false reporting
* Develop actionable reports, if necessary
* Future: Frameworks like Sensa Touch to be agnostic to tablet/phablet/smartphone models
